'''
# Arithmatic Operator 
a = 5
b = 2


print(a + b)
print(a - b)
print(a * b)
print(a / b)
print(a % b)  #reminder
print(a * b) # power
print(a // b)


# relational operator

a = 50
b = 20

print(a == b)
print(a != b)
print(a >= b)
print(a > b)
print(a <= b)
print(a < b)

# Assignment Operator 

num = 10
# num = num + 10
num += 10 
print(num)



# Logical Operator 
a = 50
b = 30

print(not False)
print(not (a > b))
